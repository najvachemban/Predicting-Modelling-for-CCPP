## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Combined+Cycle+Power+Plant)
- 9,568 hourly observations
- Features:
  - Ambient Temperature (AT)
  - Exhaust Vacuum (V)
  - Ambient Pressure (AP)
  - Relative Humidity (RH)
  - Energy Output (PE)

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Ambient Temperature and Exhaust Vacuum are the most influential variables.
- High temperatures above 25°C reduce power output by ~25.3 MW.
- Vacuum pressures outside 40–60 hPa degrade turbine efficiency.
